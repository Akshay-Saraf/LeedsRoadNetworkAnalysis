## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before running the code.

- ensure that you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system.
- Activate the Conda environment.
- ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Environment
Use the following command to set up the environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Cloning the Repository

To get started with the project, you can clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window on your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.kcl.ac.uk/K23114893/NetworkX.git
```

### Jupyter Notebook Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

2. Navigate to the `.ipynb_checkpoints` directory in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

3. Open the "Task_A.ipynb" notebook file to start exploring and analyzing the Leeds Road network data. You can then go through "Task_B.ipynb", "Task_C.ipynb", "Task_D.ipynb" for the entire coursework code.

### Branches

- Final: The `master` branch contains the finished and stable version of the project code. This branch is updated only when all development work is completed, and the code has been thoroughly tested. Users can rely on the `master` branch for the most up-to-date and reliable version of the project.
